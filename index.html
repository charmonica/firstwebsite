      <h2>Hey! I'm Chrissy.</h2>
                  <p>An unrepentant nerd based in Newark, DE but who considers the Greater Philadelphia region to be home. I'm an enthusiastic student and creator of code, voraciously consuming everything I can learn after accidentally obtaining a humanities degree.</p>

      <h2>Want to know more?</h2>
        <p>At my core, I'm just a weird kid who has always enjoyed working collaboratively as part of a team. I spent my undergraduate career at Widener University as a member of a wide variety of causes and organizations, and spent time serving as president and vice president of organizations like the LGBTQ+ Alliance and the Humanities Association. I still enjoy de-stressing the way I did then, by mucking around with the code that powers my favorite games - both web-based and otherwise. It's a little embarassing how long it took me to realize that might have been a sign that History was the wrong degree for me.</p>
        
        <p>I'm spending much of my time now formally learning the ins and outs of web development, focusing primarily on languages such as:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML/CSS</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Java</li>
      </ul>

        <p>I'm eager to work with current professionals or other learners to improve my skill and knowledge of web development, and excited by opportunities to work collaboratively.</p>

      <p>Things are a little bare around here right now but eventually this will be where I showcase the work I've done on various projects using programming languages like JavaScript or Python. It's my intention to document my work in all stages of product creation, including:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Concept design</li>
        <li>Method of production</li>
        <li>Implementation</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Below you'll find links to the finished product and GitHub repository. :)</p>
